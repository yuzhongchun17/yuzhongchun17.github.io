Hi :)
======
I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Stanford University, specializing in robotics. I currently work with [Prof. Monroe Kennedy](https://monroekennedy3.com/) in the [ARMLab](https://arm.stanford.edu/), focusing on assistive robotic arms for bimanual manipulation. Additionally, I collaborate with [Prof. Jeannette Bohg](https://web.stanford.edu/~bohg/) in the [Interactive Perception and Robot Learning Lab](https://iprl.stanford.edu/), exploring Dexterous Kinesthetic Teaching for the Allegro robot hand.

Previously, I earned my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). During my time there, I worked on a Wearable Arm Joint Movement Measuring Device in the [Human Dynamics and Controls Lab](https://hdcl.mechanical.illinois.edu/), advised by Professor [Elizabeth Hsiao-Wecksler](https://hdcl.mechanical.illinois.edu/people/liz-hsiao-wecksler/). I also contributed to the development of mapping algorithms for a high-speed autonomous quadrotor in the [Advanced Controls Research Laboratory](https://naira.mechse.illinois.edu/), advised by Professor [Naira Hovakimyan](https://mechse.illinois.edu/people/profile/nhovakim).
 
I enjoy taking photos. A lot.
